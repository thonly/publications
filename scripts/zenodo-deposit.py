"""
Deposit corpus papers to Zenodo, one DOI per paper.

WHY PER-PAPER AND NOT PER-REPO. Zenodo's GitHub integration mints one DOI for a
whole release, which is right for software and wrong for a corpus: an examiner or
a citing author looks for *a paper*, not for a tarball that contains it. Per-paper
records are the discoverable unit. The repo-level route stays available through
.zenodo.json and the two do not conflict.

WHAT THIS ADDS THAT THE CORPUS DOES NOT ALREADY HAVE. Not prior art — the public
render plus the archive snapshots already do that job, and this is not an upgrade
path to it. What a DOI adds is a *third-party institutional registry* (CERN)
carrying the record, a persistent identifier that survives the site moving or
going down, and presence in the indexes academics actually search. It is
deliberately the smallest of the three timestamp/registry layers.

SAFETY. Publishing a DOI is IRREVERSIBLE — a Zenodo record cannot be deleted once
published, only versioned. So:

    (default)      dry run: print exactly what would be sent, touch nothing
    --create       create DRAFT depositions, still unpublished and deletable
    --publish      publish (mints the DOI). Refuses to run without --create too.
    --sandbox      talk to sandbox.zenodo.org instead — fake DOIs, free to break

Always rehearse on --sandbox first. The sandbox is a full copy of the API.

USAGE
    export ZENODO_TOKEN=...            # from zenodo.org/account/settings/applications
    ./scripts/zenodo-deposit.py --sandbox --create --publish        # rehearsal
    ./scripts/zenodo-deposit.py --create                            # real drafts
    ./scripts/zenodo-deposit.py --create --publish                  # real DOIs
    ./scripts/zenodo-deposit.py --only the-zero-employee-institution

State lives in zenodo-dois.json: slug -> {concept_doi, doi, deposition_id, sha256}.
A paper whose SHA-256 has changed since its last deposit is offered as a NEW
VERSION of the existing record rather than a new record, so the concept DOI keeps
resolving to the newest text and every earlier text keeps its own DOI.

    The token is deliberately NOT kept in a dotfile, a .env, or anywhere under a
    repository. These repos hash every tracked file into a manifest that is signed
    by three trust authorities, stamped to Bitcoin, pushed to GitHub and
    snapshotted to the Internet Archive — committing a credential here would
    publish it and then cryptographically attest that it existed. The Keychain
    keeps it out of the filesystem the tooling can see.

    Store it — copy the token to the clipboard first, then:

        security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s zenodo-token \\
            -A -U -w "$(pbpaste)"

    Use -s zenodo-token-sandbox for the sandbox credential.

    ⚠️ `-A` is REQUIRED, and its absence fails silently in the worst way. Without
    it the item is created with an ACL that blocks non-interactive reads, so
    `security ... -w` returns EXIT CODE 0 AND AN EMPTY STRING — the item looks
    present, and the token looks stored, and nothing works. Verify after storing:

        security find-generic-password -s zenodo-token -w | wc -c    # expect ~61

    `$(pbpaste)` is used rather than `read -rs` (which silently captured nothing
    under zsh) or `-w` with no value (which prompts inconsistently). The token
    never appears in shell history either way: history keeps the literal
